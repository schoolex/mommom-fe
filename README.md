Buy and gift food NFTs to friends!

While it might look like a normal marketing or gifting app at first, Mommom is a blockchain powered web app that uses smart contracts deployed on the blockchain to tokenise food items into NFTs, which can be traded/gifted to friends.

The security of the blockchain ensures that your food items will not be lost, and ownership is irrefutable. Also, MoMMoM relieves reliance on 3rd party applications and middleman to ensure that your transactions are handled correctly, through the technology of the blockchain. In short, MoMMoM is a trustless, secure platform to purchase food items from vendors, and gift them to your friends!

Users of MoMMoM can sign up, and link their Metamask crypto wallet to the site. From there, they can scroll through the marketplace which offers a plethora of restaurants and menu items to choose from. Users can then easily purchase items using ether from their crypto wallets, and the smart contract will automatically issue the user with a tokenised version of the menu item - An NFT.

The NFT can be traded and gifted to friends, or consumed, which would result in the burning of the NFT.

To use the web application, a Metamask account is required, and ether on Rinkeby network. Visit: https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ to get ether for your Metamask account
